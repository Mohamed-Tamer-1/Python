🎉 Exploring Superstore Sales Insights 🎉

I’m excited to share my End-to-end data Science project on the Superstore dataset! 🛒💡

This project dives into:

📊 Top-performing categories, products, and regions

📉 Sales trends over time

🏷️ Impact of discounts on profitability

Key Highlights:

✔️ Technology leads in sales and profit margins, while Furniture requires better pricing strategies.

✔️ The Western region outperformed others in sales, signaling the potential for growth in other regions.

✔️ Seasonality plays a critical role, with sales spiking during Q4.

Using Python and libraries like Pandas, and Matplotlib, I also explored advanced metrics such as Sales Before Discount and Profit Margins by Category.

Check out the attached visualizations 📈 to see trends and actionable insights!
